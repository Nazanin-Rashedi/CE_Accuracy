  Q: I don't think that's possible to link a thread with a specific core with Mac OS X …
  A: That’s correct.
  Q: To test, I've wrote a simple program to validate and 
     it seems impossible to print from which core the thread is executing.
  A: That’s also correct.
  A: Well, there are ways to work this out but the previous point means 
     it doesn’t do you any good (by the time you look at the result, you might be running on a different CPU).

   THREAD_AFFINITY_POLICY
   is pretty well covered in the header comments within
   <Kernel/thread_policy.h>
   To wit: This policy is experimental.

   citation from <Kernel/thread_policy.h>
   This may be used to express affinity relationships between threads in
   the task. Threads with the same affinity tag will be scheduled to
   share an L2 cache if possible. That is, affinity tags are a hint to
   the scheduler for thread placement.
   
   The namespace of affinity tags is generally local to one task.
   However, a child task created after the assignment of affinity tags by
   its parent will share that namespace. In particular, a family of
   forked processes may be created with a shared affinity namespace.
